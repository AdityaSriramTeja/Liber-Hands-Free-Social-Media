# Introduction

Welcome to our Flutter app! Liber is a revolutionary social media platform that seamlessly connects people, both physically impaired and non-impaired, to the world through the power of voice, audio, and touch. This project was built using Flutter, a powerful framework for creating beautiful cross-platform applications. This README will guide you through the process of setting up and running the app on your local machine. Let's get started!
Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following software installed:

1) Flutter: Flutter is the core framework used for building this app. You can download and install Flutter from the official Flutter website (https://flutter.dev).
2) Android Studio: Android Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides the necessary tools for developing Flutter applications. You can download and install Android Studio from the official Android Studio website (https://developer.android.com/studio).

# Getting Started

To get the app up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository: Download the repository to your local machine using your preferred method (e.g., Git command line or GUI).
2) Install project dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

This will fetch and download all the required dependencies specified in the project's pubspec.yaml file.

Run the project: Once the dependencies are installed, run the following command to launch the app on your connected device or emulator:

    flutter run

This command will build and run the app on the connected device or emulator specified in your Flutter configuration.

That's it! You should now see the app running on your device or emulator. Feel free to explore the Liber: The Hands-Free Social Media.
